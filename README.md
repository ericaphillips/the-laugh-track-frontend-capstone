## The Laugh Track

## Why?
Users should be able to keep a list of comedy specials they've watched with useful information like their rating, where to find the special, and other things. 
Users should also be able to keep a list of their favorite comedians with some basic information about them, such as what they've watched by that comedian and their comments about the comedian.
